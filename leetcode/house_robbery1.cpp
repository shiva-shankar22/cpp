/*

 In this problem there are houses in a street and House robber has to rob these houses. But the problem is that he canâ€™t rob more than one house successively i.e which are adjacent to each other. Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, we have to find out the maximum amount of money he can get.

Example
nums = [1,2,3,1]
4
Explanation:House Robber

Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

nums = [2,7,9,3,1]
12
Explanation:


Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and then 5th (money = 1).
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
